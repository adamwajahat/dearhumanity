          <div className='italicFont'>Dear Humanity,</div>
          <br></br>
          <div>Welcome to the world. The world not seen around you but the world that is shown to you. The world where the oppressed stands as the villian and the oppressor is paraded as the hero. The world where a cry for help from the weak lands on deaf ears and the scenes of massacres are blinded by the tv screens. The world where no one knows what psyops is but everyone believes in it.</div>
          <br></br>
          <div>Welcome to where falsehood has become truth and truth has become falsehood.</div>
          <br></br>
          <div><span className='italicFont'> Humanity?</span> I am dying. Can you feel the pain or not? <span className='italicFont'>Where have you gone? Why have you forgotten me?</span> As the war planes fly over our homes and food sources run dry, you stand around. Years of this cycle but now, this oppression, has murdered my name, the weak, as the tryant.</div>
          <br></br>
          <div>To find me please, you first have to find the truth. Educate yourself and do not consume what you are shown. Then work on those around you. One individual at a time.</div>
          <br></br>
          <div>Palestine, I am sorry. </div>
          <br></br>

          <div className='ending'><span className='italicFont'>Allah please accept our duaas and forgive us for our weakness,</span>
